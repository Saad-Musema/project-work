This is a repository to work on class projects of section-D 2nd Year SE students at AASTU. 


Group-2

Our project includes:

1)    A company wants to transmit data over the telephone, but they are concerned that their phones may be tapped. All of their data are transmitted as four-digit integers. They have asked you to write a program that encrypts their data so that it can be transmitted more securely. Your program should read a four-digit integer and encrypt it as follows: Replace each digit by (the sum of that digit plus 7) modulus 10. Then, swap the first digit with the third, swap the second digit with the fourth and print the encrypted integer and vice versa to decrypt the number. Write a program that inputs four-digit integer and either encrypt to secrecy the inputted number or decrypt it to form the original number. The program should allow the user to choose among encryption and decryption operation.
